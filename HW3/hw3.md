Hi Dr. Bolker and Dr. Forkutza,,

I am writing to inform you that I have updated my HW3 submission and have attached two files: Stats790A3_Updated.pdf and Stats790A3_Updated.Rmd. 
I apologize for the delay in submitting my work; last week was particularly busy and stressful for me.

I would appreciate it if you could review and grade the updated version of my HW3. Thank you once again for your understanding and support.

                                                                                                              Best, Hanwen Ju
